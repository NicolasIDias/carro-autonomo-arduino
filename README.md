# Autonomous car Arduino project
School robotics project v1.3.

To use this code, modify the motor and sensor ports according to your robot. Two AFMotors and two ultrasonic sensors were used as programmable mechanical parts. The assembly instructions for building the robot can be found on Google.
Example: ```
const int esquerdaFrente = 10;
const int esquerdaTras = 11;
const int direitaFrente = 12;
const int direitaTras = 13;

const int triggerPin1 = 8; 
const int echoPin1 = 4;    
const int triggerPin2 = 7; 
const int echoPin2 = 5;

```
